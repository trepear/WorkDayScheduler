# Work Day Scheduler

https://trepear.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/

This is a simple "planner" where the user is able to write "to-do's", plans, appointments, etc. in time blocks. The current hour is always red, the past is always gray and the future is always green. Once the user writes something in the text-area, they are able to save the text locally by clicking the "save button"!
